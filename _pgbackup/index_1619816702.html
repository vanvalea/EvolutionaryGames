            <p>Game theory is the study of the ways in which the strategies of interacting agents produce outcomes. Since it was first introduced by Jon von Neumann, game theory has come to be used to describe relations between humans, animals, and computers. It has achieved a general scope with application in the fields of economics, biology, social science, and others.</p>
            <p>The first implementation of game theory to our understanding of conflict, cooperation, and strategies in evolving populations in biology comes from &ldquo;The Logic of Animal Conflict&rdquo; by John Maynard Smith and G. R. Price. Evolutionary game theory focuses on the dynamics of strategy change, disequilibria, and evolutionary stable strategies. For these applications, strategies are pre-programmed behavioral policies or instructions, not rational decisions.</p>
            <p>Evolutionary game theory has contributed to our understanding of interactions and fitness consequences for many systems. The hawk-dove example helps to illustrate my organisms with lethal armaments often back down to avoid fights that may lead to lethal injuries. The side-blotched lizard populations maintain 3 polymorphic colorations in a 4-year cycle by a rock-paper-scissors like mating strategy. Even simple organisms like microorganisms can develop complex dynamical interactions that can be understood through a game theoretical framework.</p>
